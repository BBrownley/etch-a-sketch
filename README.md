# etch-a-sketch

This project is part of "The Odin Project" cirriculum, where we are assigned to create a clone of the "Etch-A-Sketch" toy. 
I plan to add additional functionality to this project in the future, including an option to set the opacity of the brush, along with a backend that will allow users to submit their sketches for others to see.
